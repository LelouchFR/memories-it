<h1 align='center'>Memories-it !</h1>

<p align='center'>a simple memory game using <a href="https://vuejs.org/">vue</a> & <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">scss</a>.</p>

I've made this game with my sister @littledemoon who helped with the artwork of the memory cards and I worked on the programming of the fonctionalities of the game. I got this idea when I remembered in my childhood I was playing some memory, so I thought to myself, why not making one but using vue so I try some new technologies.
